Postgres SQL portfolio Project
This is a music record store project and the store need to determine which artist album will be bought and add to the store. Also the sales data is required to be look into to check the performsnce of the sales support employees.
This project will involve creating a database, creating tables and importing the datasets as well as a lot of joins.
While creatint table, I ensured the column names on the files is same as the ones used in creating the table. 

The queries can be found in the uploaded query file.txt
